## Customization
- Update images in the `public/` folder for branding.
- Modify styles in `src/App.css` and `src/index.css`.
- Extend components in `src/components/` for new features.

## Technical Details

### API
- Uses [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) for fetching movie data.
- API requests are made using the Fetch API with a Bearer token stored in the `.env` file as `VITE_TMDB_API_KEY`.
- Endpoints used:
	- `GET /search/movie?query=...` for searching movies
	- `GET /discover/movie?sort_by=popularity.desc` for popular movies

### Main Components
- `App.jsx`: Handles state, API calls, and renders the main layout.
- `Search.jsx`: Search input component with debounced input for efficient API calls.
- `MovieCard.jsx`: Displays movie poster, title, rating, language, and release year.

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state and side effects.
- Debouncing implemented with `react-use`'s `useDebounce` to limit API calls while typing.

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first, responsive design.
- Custom styles in `App.css` and `index.css`.

### Tooling
- Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and hot module replacement.
- Linting with ESLint and recommended React plugins.
